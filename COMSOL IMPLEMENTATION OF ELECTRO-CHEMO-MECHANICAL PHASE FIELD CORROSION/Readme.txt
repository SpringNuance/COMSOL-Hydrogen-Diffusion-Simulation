In this folder, we provide two COMSOL models that correspond to the following three publications:

Paper1: Cui C, Ma R, Martínez-Pañeda E. A phase field formulation for dissolution-driven stress corrosion cracking. Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids, 2021, 147: 104254.
		DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmps.2020.104254
Paper2: Cui C, Ma R, Martínez-Pañeda E. A generalised, multi-phase-field theory for dissolution-driven stress corrosion cracking and hydrogen embrittlement. Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids, 2022, 166: 104951.
		DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmps.2022.104951
Paper3: Cui C, Ma R, Martínez-Pañeda E. Electro-chemo-mechanical phase field modeling of localized corrosion: theory and COMSOL implementation. Engineering with Computers, 2023.
		DOI: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00366-023-01833-8	

If using these models for research or industrial purposes, please kindly cite the aforementioned papers.		

The model titled 'ElectroChemoMechanicalPFcorrosion.mph' corresponds to the second case study (Section 4.2) of our Paper3. 
All parameters and variables are well described in the paper. Details of the implementation can be found in Section 3.

The model titled 'PhaseFieldCorrosion.mph' corresponds to the phase field corrosion model employed in Paper1 and Paper2, where the effects of ionic species transport and electrostatic potential are not explicitly included. 
The ABAQUS implementation of this model can be downlowaded from https://www.empaneda.com/codes/ (ABAQUS UEL FOR PHASE FIELD MODELLING OF CORROSION). 

Do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.
